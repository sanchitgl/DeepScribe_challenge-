        "text": "Sumatriptan can cause a sensation of tightness or pressure in your chest or throat, dizziness, or fatigue. If you experience severe chest pain or shortness of breath, you should seek immediate medical attention. The ondansetron rarely causes side effects but can sometimes lead to headaches, which obviously isn't ideal given your situation, so let me know if you think it's making things worse."

        "text": "Yes, several things. First, try to maintain a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends. Stress management is important, so consider techniques like meditation or deep breathing exercises. Keep a headache diary to track potential triggers - note what you ate, your stress levels, sleep quality, and other factors when a headache occurs. Some people find that certain foods trigger migraines, particularly aged cheeses, processed meats, alcohol (especially red wine), and foods containing MSG or artificial sweeteners."

Prescribed sumatriptan 50mg, take at onset of headache or aura, may repeat after 2 hours if needed, not to exceed 200mg in 24 hours.\n3. Ondansetron 4mg as needed for nausea.\n4. Advised on lifestyle modifications: regular sleep schedule, stress management techniques, keeping a headache diary to identify triggers.\n5. Discussed warning signs that would necessitate immediate medical attention.\n6. Follow-up appointment in 3 weeks to review MRI results and medication efficacy."
